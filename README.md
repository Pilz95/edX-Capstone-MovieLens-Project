# edX-Capstone-MovieLens-Project

This project is a part of the Harvard 125.9x "Data Science: Capstone MovieLens Project". It builds and evaluates recommender 
systems for the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data set. The final model used an implementation of 
the [LIBMF library](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libmf/). 

The final RMSE was 0.78611 compared to a target RMSE of 0.86490 set by the course.

The bibtex file contains the library, the script "(movielens_capstone_project_RScript.R\) saves all data in a .RData file which
is imported by the .Rmd script to generate the report.
